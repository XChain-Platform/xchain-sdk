 * The SDK's activation registry: every flag-day table the twinned carriers
 * at the top of src/ read, as (key, value) rows keyed '<stem>.<EXPORT>',
 * the spelling the fleet's rules digest and signed GATES field already use.
 * The carriers keep their predicates and read their tables from here, so a
 * table lives in ONE place per repo and a moved carrier can no longer read
 * as "not yet active".
 *
 * This file is the ENTRY. The rows live in the part files under
 * gate_registry/: shared_rows_1.js to shared_rows_5.js are BYTE TWINS of
 * xchain-indexer/src/protocol_changes/shared_rows_1.js to _5.js (the SHARED
 * block every consumer of this platform judges), shared_rows.js is the twin
 * of the queue they write into and regtest_env.js the twin of the arming
 * grammar it reads, and core.js is the consumer core the other consumers copy
 * byte for byte. Copy with cp, prove with cmp: nothing in a twin is edited
 * here, and no key, spelling or order in the block changes inside a window.
 *
 * REGTEST ARMING is applied WHEN A ROW IS READ (shared_rows.js registerRows
 * installs it as the core's read overlay): the block writes the five
 * venue-armed regtest entries UNPINNED, the registry stores that committed
 * table, and every get(), copy(), rows() and activeAt() arms the entry from
 * this process's environment as it stands at that moment. The overlay reads
 * through config.js's env getters, never process.env directly, per
 * CODE-STYLE.md's module-shape rule; registryEnv below is a live read-through
 * (getter-backed) view over the three variables the arming grammar names.
 *
 * Readers get(), copy(), has(), keys(), rows() and activeAt(). A miss THROWS a
 * RegistryMissError naming the key: a row a build lacks is a build defect and
 * never a network state. Nothing may add a row after this module loads.
 *
 * SDK-ONLY GATES: none. Every twinned carrier's table is in the SHARED
 * block, so this repo registers no rows of its own.
